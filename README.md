# ESLint Prettier Boilerplate

Starter repository for a JS project using ESLint and Prettier recommended rules
and styles.

## Installation

Clone the Git repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/travishorn/eslint-prettier-boilerplate.git
```

## Usage

Start developing.

Any files with extension `.js` can be linted against ESLint and Prettier
recommended rules.

```
npm run lint
```

You can automatically fix some problems.

```
npm run lint:fix
```

## Editor Setup

If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can install the ESLint extension, which
will automatically highlight warnings and errors using this boilerplate.

1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + X** or click the **Extenstions** button
2. Search for **ESLint**
3. Click the **Install** button next to the **ESLint** search result

With this extension, you can also choose to automatically fix/format your code
when you save. Add the following to your Visual Studio Code settings.

```
"eslint.autoFixOnSave": true
```

This setting only takes effect if  `files.autoSave` is set to `off`,
`onFocusChange`, or `onWindowChange`.
